## Executive summary

This report and repository investigate the properties of the wind generated by the University of Auckland's boundary layer wind tunnel (BLWT) in three different configurations: no upstream obstruction, obstruction from a fine grid, and obstruction from a coarse grid. Measurements are recorded using a Cobra probe mounted on a traverse rig. In addition, measurements are repeated in 5 locations: at the centre of the wind tunnel, as well as 0.5 m upstream, downstream, to the left, and to the right. Data is recorded at 4 altitudes: 0.1, 0.75, 1.25, and 1.5 m. Wind speeds from 5 to 15 m/s are found to be achievable, while turbulence intensities of 1.0%, 5.6%, and 10% are achieved under the no grid, fine grid, and coarse grid conditions respectively. The frequency domain characteristics are analysed, showing good match with a theoretical outdoors model at frequencies above 8 Hz for the coarse grid. However, low frequency power is found to be lacking in all cases, which may limit the range of conditions the wind tunnel can simulate.

## 1 Experimental setup

This section describes the physical and software set-up used to record time history data for a variety of probe locations and flow conditions.

### 1.1 Physical setup

The University of Auckland's Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel (BLWT), shown in __Figure 1__, is 3.5 m wide and 2.5 m tall. Flight experiments are to be conducted in a specific location around half-way down the length of the wind tunnel. The centre of the cross section of the wind tunnel at that location (1.25 m altitude, 1.75 m from either wall) is considered as the nominal flight location.

__Figure 1__: Downstream view of the boundary layer wind tunnel.

The tunnel has mounting points for turbulence generating grids 4 m upstream of the nominal flight location. All measurements taken for this experiments are repeated under 3 different conditions: no upstream grid, a fine grid with 0.2 m x 0.2 m holes, and a coarse grid with 0.4 m x 0.4 m holes.

A Cobra probe from [Turbulent Flow Instrumentation](https://www.turbulentflow.com.au/) (TFI) [1] is used to record wind data. It is mounted on a motorised traverse rig, which makes it possible to change the altitude of the probe from a computer. Both the Cobra probe and the traverse rigs are connected to a Windows computer running LabVIEW and the TFI Device Control software.

In order to investigate spatial variations in flow characteristics, measurements were taken at 5 different locations and 4 different altitudes. The first location is located at the nominal flight location in the centre of the wind tunnel, while the remaining four are located 0.5 m upstream, downstream, to the left, and to the right of the nominal flight location. The four altitudes, measured between the floor of the wind tunnel and the holes of the Cobra probe, are 0.1, 0.75, 1.25, and 1.5 m.

The wind tunnel fans can be controlled from a dial. For the purpose of this test, the flow properties are measured at 4 different dial settings: 25, 35, 50, and 65%.

Thirty seconds of wind data is recorded using the Cobra probe for each combination of experimental variables. In summary, measurements are taken for 3 types of upstream obstructions, at 5 different locations and 4 different altitudes, for 4 different dial settings, yielding a total of 240 combinations, as shown in __Table 1__. This corresponds to 120 min of wind data.

__Table 1__: Experimental variables. 

| Variables            | Possible values                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Upstream obstruction | No grid, fine grid, coarse grid     |
| x/y location (m)     | 0/0, 0/+0.5, 0/-0.5, +0.5/0, -0.5/0 |
| Altitude (m)         | 0.1, 0.75, 1.25, 1.5                |
| Fan setting (%)      | 25, 35, 50, 65                      |

### 1.2 Software set-up procedure

The following procedure is followed to initially set-up the system:

- Ensure the Cobra probe and the traverse rigs are connected to the PC.
- Open the `TFI Device Control` panel from the start menu.
    - Click `Settings -> Devices`. The Cobra probe DeviceID, in this case `113`, should be listed in the `Active Devices` window.
    - Ensure the probe is set to `1-Probe cable`.
    - Record the DAQ number; in this case `6255`.
- Open the `WEG Cobra` Labview program from `D:\Labview Programs\WEG Cobra\WEG Cobra.exe`.
- In `WEG Cobra`:
    - Check and record the still air temperature and pressure.

After the set-up phase, the traverse rig is moved to the desired location, the wind tunnel is switched on, and the fan control dial is set to the desired wind speed. The following procedure is then followed for each set of measurements:

- In `WEG Cobra`:
    - Set the sampling rate to 1250 Hz and the sampling time to 31.1296 s.
    - Set the traverse rig altitudes to 100, 750, 1250, and 1500 mm.
    - In the output options, check both checkboxes.
    - Set the appropriate output file name for the current test using the format `<gridType>_<location>_<dialSetting>`, where:
        - `<gridType>` is `coarsegrid`, `finegrid`, or `nogrid`, and corresponds to the type of grid mounted upstream.
        - `<location>` is `back`, `center`, `front`, `left`, or `right`, which corresponds to the location the probe is mounted at.
        - `dialSetting` is `25`, `35`, `50`, or `65`, which correspond to the percentage the wind tunnel fan control dial is set to.
        - Note: the height is appended automatically to the file name. It takes the form `_0`, `_1`, `_2`, or `_3`, which correspond to probe mounting elevations of 0.1, 0.75, 1.25, and 1.5 m respectively.
    - Zero the probe using the appropriate button before the first recording, and once again every 20-30 minutes to account for changes in ambient temperature and pressure.
- Before each recording, use `TFI Device Control` to ensure that the percentage of good data at the current wind speed and location is above 80%.
- Back in `WEG Cobra`:
    - Start the recording. The traverse rig then moves to the desired altitudes and the software records the desired amount of data.

## 2 Results and discussion

__Figure 2__ shows the mean wind speed recorded at the nominal flight altitude of 1.25 m for different horizontal locations, fan input settings, and upstream obstructions. The horizontal location of the probe does not seem to have a significant impact on the mean wind speed, with differences of less than 6% compared to the centre location in all cases. As expected, increasing the fan setting increases the mean wind speed, going from between 5 and 6 m/s at 25% to between 12.5 and 15 m/s at 65%. From previous testing, the speed at 65% is high enough to prove challenging for drones to handle, and there is therefore no need to use higher fan settings. Adding a grid upstream decreases the mean wind speed in all cases, with the effect more pronounced at higher fan settings. The coarse grid results in less flow reduction, with an average wind speed reduction of 9.5%, than the fine grid, with an average wind speed reduction of 12.4%. This result is expected, as the blockage area of the fine grid is higher.

__Figure 3__ shows the turbulence intensity of the flow at the nominal flight altitude for different fan settings, horizontal locations, and upstream obstructions. The fan setting does not seem to have a significant impact on the magnitude of the turbulence intensity for the fine grid and no grid cases. In the case of the coarse grid, a slight increase of about 4% in turbulence intensity is seen at the maximum fan setting. Adding a grid upstream does increase the turbulence intensity significantly, with average turbulence intensities of 1.0%, 5.6%, and 10% for the no grid, fine grid, and coarse grid cases. The extremely low turbulence intensity without upstream grids is expected, as the tunnel was specifically designed for this purpose. The coarse grid results in higher turbulence intensities likely due to its larger gap size. On the other hand, using an upstream obstruction causes the horizontal placement of the probe to have an effect on the recorded turbulence intensity. This is especially visible with the coarse grid, where the turbulence intensity changes by around 1% between the front and centre locations, and by another percent between the centre and back locations. This indicates turbulences amplitude is decaying as the flow moves away from the grid, which might need to be taken into account for assessing free-flight performance. The left and right locations on the other hand do not show significantly different results from the centre location.

__Figure 4__ investigates the frequency content of the wind by showing its normalised power spectral density (PSD) in the centre location, for different upstream obstructions, altitudes, and input fan settings. In addition, the theoretical PSD obtained from a von Kármán model [2] for a countryside environment with trees and hedges at an altitude of 1.25 m is displayed as a comparison point. __Appendix A.1__ shows results for the other horizontal locations. Confirming the previous results, for altitudes 0.75 m and above, the coarse grid is found to result in a higher power than the fine grid at all frequencies, which is itself found to result in a higher power than the no grid case. The results at an altitude of 0.1 m are less clear cut, as the flow is not fully developed. Flying at such low altitudes is unlikely, but should nonetheless be avoided if consistent results are needed. When compared with the theoretical PSD, the experimental results for the coarse grid shows a similar power at frequencies higher than 8 Hz, but all experimental results show a significantly lower power at low frequencies. In particular, the peak in the experimental PSDs is found around 8 Hz, whereas that of the von Kármán model is found at around 0.03 Hz. This indicates that the wind generated by the wind tunnel is lacking in low frequency content. As a consequence, the suitability of the generated flow to a specific application needs to seriously considered.

## 3 Conclusions

- A Cobra probe was used to measure the characteristics of the flow in the University of Auckland's boundary layer wind tunnel in 240 combinations of wind tunnel fan setting, probe horizontal location, probe altitude, and upstream obstruction, which consisted of no grid, a fine grid, and a coarse grid.
- Mean wind speeds from 5 to 15 m/s were achieved by varying the fan setting from 25 to 65%.
- Turbulence intensities of 1.0%, 5.6%, and 10% were achieved under the no grid, fine grid, and coarse grid conditions respectively.
- When compared to a theoretical von Kármán PSD, the power of the generated wind was similar for frequencies above 8 Hz when using the coarse grid. However, the experimental power at frequencies below 8 Hz was significantly lower than that expected from theory.
- The turbulence intensity when using grids decreased as the distance from the grid increased, with a difference of around 2% per metre within the testing boundaries.
- Flow properties when moving sideways from the centre of the wind tunnel were found to be relatively consistent.
